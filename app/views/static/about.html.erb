        Hello, My name is Jacob Moore! I am currently a student at Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights,
        Kentucky, where I attend the College of Informatics for a degree in Computer Science. I am currently a Junior
        by credit, and have a specific interest in the space industry. I have spent over a complete year of my life
        working as an intern at NASA. The centers I have worked at include NASA's
        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard" target="_blank"> Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in Greenbelt, Maryland,
        NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html" target="_blank"> Kennedy Space Center</a>
        in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html" target="_blank">
        Johnson Space Center</a> in Houston, Texas.

        While at Goddard, I worked on an open-sourced iOS based application called LandCast. NASA currently has a
        satellite called LandSat-8 that gathers a plethora of land, oceanic, and arctic data about our planet. LandCast
        gathers this data and displays it in an easy to read and understand format. I was given resources that linked
        me to this information directly, and contributed to the project by debugging and improving the application in
        order to get it ready to be moved to open-source. This was my first project with NASA, and you can read more
        about it <%=link_to "here", project_path(4) %>.

        While at Kennedy (where I spent the most of my time with the administration), I began by developing web
        applications. We primarily coded using Ruby and the Ruby on Rails framework. The applications I developed gave
        me the knowledge to make this website you are currently on right now! The main application I worked on was a
        web application designed to allow users to manipulate and derive reports from data files and code blocks. The
        application also had a scheduling system that allowed users to monitor what stages their code was in during
        the development process.

        When I wasn't working as a web developer, I was moved over to an automation team in the engineering directorate
        at Kennedy Space Center. I worked with a team of 8 other interns where we would automate testing software for
        America's next deep-space spacecraft called the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. To learn more about my work
        and the current projects that I am both personally and professionally involved with, please visit my

        It is my personal belief that humanity serves a greater purpose in this universe. I work hard everyday to inform
        people of the fragility of life, and that we need to extend humanities reaches into space if we wish for the
        human experience to persist into the future. I will be a part of that mission, and I will work to make others
        see my vision of the future.

        I graduated from Simon Kenton High School with a work ethic diploma, and received
        a full tuition Scholarship to Northern Kentucky University called The Educational Diversity Scholarship. I was
        also offered The Achiever's Award Scholarship. I graduated on the Dean's List of my high school.

      <p class="col-md-12">
        In college, I have been on the Dean's List for both my Freshman and Sophomore year. Near the end on my
        freshman year I was awarded the Outstanding First-Year Student award (pictured above). I was also accepted into
        the honors program by my freshman year.
